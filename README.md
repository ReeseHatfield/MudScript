# Welcome to MudScript!
Because who doesn't love the marriage of Java, JavaScript, and inefficiency?

## Description
If you've ever laid awake at night, yearning for the perfect mishmash of Java's verbose charm and JavaScript's laissez-faire attitude, your prayers have been answered. MudScript: the IDE that leaves all the good parts behind.

## Features
- A window! To write code in!
- A "Compile" button, because we heard you like to live dangerously.

## Why MudScript?
Do you love the simplicity of vim but HATE the efficiency? Want to take a step back from the intuitive, user-friendly interfaces of modern IDEs and go back to the days of pure, unfiltered chaos? Look no further, dear developer, MudScript has you covered.

## Getting Started
Installation is a breeze...if you understand the inscrutable error messages.

```
git clone https://github.com/ReeseHatfield/MudScript.git 
cd mudscript
javac *.java
java MudScript
```

## Usage
1. Write some JavaScript code in the provided text window. Syntax highlighting? Code completion? We've thrown those into the abyss.
2. Click the "Compile" button. We hope you've kept your fingers crossed.
3. Watch in amazement, horror, or confusion as MudScript interprets your code using Java's ScriptEngine class.
4. Repeat until your sanity has been questioned.

Enjoy your journey into the heart of inefficiency!
